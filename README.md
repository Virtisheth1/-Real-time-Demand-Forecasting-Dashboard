our team spearheaded a transformative project centered on developing a real-time Demand Forecasting Dashboard for cafeteria operations. Leveraging Tableau-based visualization workflows, 
we facilitated daily and seasonal insights into food item demand, enabling informed decision-making on inventory, resource allocation, and human capital management. Our implementation of a dynamic demand forecasting model, powered by 
machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics, yielded impressive results. We achieved a substantial 20% reduction in food waste by accurately predicting demand patterns, a pivotal milestone in enhancing operational efficiency.

Our methodology encompassed comprehensive data handling, including Python-based data cleaning and transformation into SQL for improved accessibility. Notably, our team crafted a time series econometrics model that not only bolstered 
operational efficiency but also led to a remarkable 20% reduction in human capital allocated to food production. The success and impact of our model were profound, leading to its adoption by the University cafeteria for daily informed 
decision-making processes.

Our project's core achievements lie in creating a robust framework that seamlessly integrated data analytics and statistical modeling. This initiative not only optimized cafeteria operations but also contributed significantly to reducing
waste and streamlining human resource allocation. Our expertise in statistical modeling and analytics played a pivotal role in realizing these outcomes, marking a testament to the power of data-driven solutions in enhancing operational
efficacy.
